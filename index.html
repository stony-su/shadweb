                    <p class="workshop-speaker">By Daniel Moges</p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Yesterday, we departed from Bruce Peninsula National Park. After a vigorous race to the showers and a plethora of mosquito bite itching, we had a very insightful lecture on Transportation in Canada by Jon, where we learned about the deeper thought process behind designing intersections. A variety of pros, cons, and projects were discussed and analyzed in an insightful manner. Lastly, we were also introduced to SHAD seminars! You (that’s right, YOU!) can give a 5 minute presentation to your fellow SHADs. The presentations are on the 15th, so start planning!

                    <h3 class="workshop-title">Workshop A: Anatomy</h3>
                    <p class="workshop-speaker">By Michael Yang and Sae Janin</p>
                    <div class="workshop-content">
                        <p>
                            Anatomy is a highly sought-after workshop. Human cadavers are an expensive commodity that Waterloo is fortunate to have, and thus, everyone must pay respect to those who have donated their bodies to science. Before even entering the lab, it is required to sign waivers and “terms of service.” No taking pictures and no joking around.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, we walked to the Health building (HLTH), situated right after the PAC/SLC (during the scavenger hunt). The lab itself is located on the third floor, and each person must put their belongings in lockers when entering through the two double doors. The Anatomy lab is in the form of a T; as you walk through the middle, it expands at the sides. Upon entering, the stench of alcohol is overpowering, as it is mainly used as embalming fluid (preservative). The presentation started off with a very strict review of the rules, especially emphasizing respect for the donors and their families.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then we got to explore amazing parts of the human body! The workshop was organized in small stations, each focusing on different parts of the body. All specimens were already partly or fully dissected. There was a station where we saw up close the anterior and posterior parts of the body, notably the muscles, tendons, and bones. It was fascinating to actually see in real life what we look like on the inside. We were able to touch these parts and ask all the questions that crossed our minds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, there were some people who presented abnormalities in their systems. For instance, there was a person who had a larger heart than average due to a possible condition. We were actually able to hold this heart, feel its texture, and grasp its size. There were also others who had surgeries such as knee replacements or an entire hip replacement, allowing us to examine the structure of these devices and how they were implemented into the body.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a truly extraordinary and unique experience that we are so lucky to have, thanks to these generous donors. If it weren’t for them, we would not have been able to have this time of discovery. So, a deep thanks to all those who have chosen to donate in the name of science. We also express our gratitude to the families of these people. Truly, a big thank you from all the Shads!

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        The Quantum Mechanics workshop was a fascinating journey into one of science’s most intriguing fields. We explored concepts such as superposition, photons, and electromagnetic waves—topics that, while complex, sparked our curiosity and left us eager to learn more. But this workshop was more than just theory: it was brought to life through engaging demonstrations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        We watched balloons shrink dramatically in liquid nitrogen, only to spring back to life as they warmed. Using lasers, we measured the width of a single strand of hair. The highlight, however, was witnessing a superconductor in action—a metal disk hovering above magnets, seemingly defying gravity. These hands-on experiments made the abstract ideas of quantum mechanics tangible and memorable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        By the end, we were all left marveling at the wonders of the quantum world, inspired to shout: “QUANTUM!”

                        Are you fascinated by geometric shapes? If so, don’t miss the crochet roundtable at Salon! What started as a cozy pastime during our camping nights has blossomed into a nightly tradition. Led by Susan, these crochet sessions offer more than just crafting—they’re a hands-on way to explore geometric forms, including complex shapes like hyperbolic surfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Crocheting is the perfect way to relax your mind and stretch your fingers after a day of challenging math or physics. Susan’s handmade creations—from stylish hats to adorable crocheted cats and dogs—never fail to impress and delight.

                    <p class="workshop-speaker">By Darren Su</p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        The business workshop led by Susan was a fascinating session on various business models used around the world. Each model is built around three key components: how to create, deliver, and capture value.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        The "create" phase refers to how a business produces its products. This can involve in-house manufacturing, outsourcing production to another company, forming partnerships with other businesses, or even having customers participate in the creation process (like IKEA’s model).
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Next, companies must "deliver" their product, service, or experience to customers. For physical products, this might include direct-to-consumer retail, selling to retailers who distribute the goods globally, online unit sales, or digital downloads.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Services, on the other hand, require different delivery methods. These include onsite service (where customers visit the business), delivery (where the service provider goes to the customer), or online (where the service is provided virtually and instantly).
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        When it comes to experiences—such as visiting Disneyland or Niagara Falls—value is often delivered through the location itself, whether through entertainment or natural beauty. Increasingly, experiences can also be delivered online via streaming or virtual platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Finally, the "capture" stage describes how a business earns revenue. The most common method is direct sales, exchanging goods or services for cash. However, there are many alternative models, including rentals, pay-per-use, and subscriptions. Some specialized methods include brokerage fees, where a business takes a cut from transactions it facilitates (like in real estate), and licensing, where others pay to use your brand or system (as in franchises).
