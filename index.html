                            Waterloo professor and Rice graduate, Ting Tsui, explained the impacts of Nano Technology Engineering and potential career paths. Firstly, Nano Technology Engineering(NE) has a massive societal impact in the development of chips.Their impact is vast, enabling semiconductor integrated circuits in technology: from batteries and software modeling to medical imaging and even the COVID-19 vaccine. Imagine a world without chips: no social media, transportation, AI, or communication devices!" Secondly, Engineering in general is a very vast field. There are many paths which include: micro and nano-instrumentation, nano-electronics, nano-biosystems, and nano-engineered materials. Overall, 2% of Nano Technology Engineering graduates go to startups, 54% industry(jobs), 44% advanced studies(e.g. PH.D, MS, MD, MBA, JD, ETC.). Breaking down into specific fields,  21% of graduates enter software, 13% electronics, 12% finance, 12% manufacturing, 11% commercial engineering, 9% healthcare, 7% academic, 3% law, 3% design building,  2% environment, and 7% other fields.

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                     Our trip to the farmers market was, quite simply, astounding. The sight of all these people coming together to create a place where people could eat, buy, and relax was heartwarming. While there, us SHADs got to split off and all have our own little adventures. Some people watched sword jugglers (@simon_says_show), some people bought posters, some people ate pasta out of a cheese wheel, and some people (Auritro) ate a whole turkey leg by themself. From posters, to plants, to hats, to sunglasses, and even watches, so many precious items were found at the market. Even a free potato!!

The shads have run ANOTHER rec (who would have guessed!) this time it was by house 4 and 6 together. Started with capture the flag- not capture the flag - but capture the flag well kinda it was with multiple balls and worked with tag rules. There was camping, jailbreaks and insane plays the perfect environment for a good time with the boys. Afterwards we played Californian kickball (or soccer baseball) which was a blast, literally! The amount of times we saw that ball fly into the distance probably made some of us blind! With a lot of screaming to boot, even the counselors got into it and especially milo! The final score of the game was 8-3 somewhat of a landslide but  everyone came out having a blast.

                        Are you fascinated by geometric shapes? If so, don‚Äôt miss the crochet roundtable at Salon! What started as a cozy pastime during our camping nights has blossomed into a nightly tradition. Led by Susan, these crochet sessions offer more than just crafting‚Äîthey‚Äôre a hands-on way to explore geometric forms, including complex shapes like hyperbolic surfaces.

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Crocheting is the perfect way to relax your mind and stretch your fingers after a day of challenging math or physics. Susan‚Äôs handmade creations‚Äîfrom stylish hats to adorable crocheted cats and dogs‚Äînever fail to impress and delight.
