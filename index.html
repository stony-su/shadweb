                        Some of y'all might have noticed that you or your friends have been feeling a bit under the weather recently. That would be due to none other than what I‚Äôve dubbed the Shad Plague, which is probably some sort of cold or flu. It‚Äôs not too serious, but being sick isn‚Äôt fun and spreading contagions is, like, the least nonchalant thing you could do.
                        So what should you do about it? If you‚Äôre feeling unwell, I‚Äôd recommend that you:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="workshop-content" style="margin-left:2em; padding-left:1.5em;"></ul>
                        <li>Wear a mask</li>
                        <li>Inform a PA or director</li>
                        <li>Drink lots of water</li>
                        <li>Rest (A LOT)</li>
                        <li>SLEEP</li>
                        <li>Drink tea (ginger is a great choice) or otherwise consume warm liquids</li>
                        <li>Take warm showers</li>
                        <li>If you need to, skip scheduled activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="workshop-content"></p>
                          Even if you feel fine, you should DEFINITELY STILL SLEEP and take care of yourself.

                            Today in the Anatomy lab, the lab volunteers introduced the cardiovascular system. There were multiple cadavers, full body and isolated parts, of the heart and the organs who contribute to the cardiovascular system.

                            They talked about the major arteries and veins such as the Superior and Inferior vena cava and Aorta. It was truly eye opening to actually see in real life how they worked and are organised. Also, some of these cadavers had the unfortunate fate of myxofibrosarcoma (cancer) in the lungs leading to hive formations of tumors. We also discovered how pacemakers are implemented and how they work. This session made us realize just how well our body is organized and its amazing ability of homeostasis!

                        In part 2 of today‚Äôs Quantum mechanics lab held in EV2-2069, John Donohue, Naina Agarwal, and Khanjan Soni covered two main components. The workshop focused on polarization, which is the direction of light, oscillating in an electric field; and quantum cryptography, which explores the study of quantum mechanics to secure community channels.
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        We used a Quantum Key distribution system (QKD) that simulates message transmission using the filtering of laser light through polarizers. We saw firsthand how quantum mechanics could be used to make efficient and secure communications channels. The workshop demonstrates how quantum principles like superposition and measurement uncertainty can be used for cool stuff like super secret‚Ä¶ *ahem* spy activity...*ahem*!

                        Waterloo Civil Engineer alumni, our dear Jon Martin, continues his presentation in civil engineering, and today, he covered key innovations in Civil Engineering for the better of society, and the math concepts in their construction.
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        These innovations that he explained are: basket weaved roads, which is a type of interchange where one highway interchanges itself, and double and turbo roundabouts, which help decrease the speeds of vehicles in which is minimizing the effects of accidents. In addition, Jon explains the math concept of centrifugal force where the friction force arises in a rotating motion. Building off centrifugal forces, he explains superelevation, a crucial design technique that counteracts the centrifugal forces when skidding and turning when travelling on a curve.

                        Are you fascinated by geometric shapes? If so, don‚Äôt miss the crochet roundtable at Salon! What started as a cozy pastime during our camping nights has blossomed into a nightly tradition. Led by Susan, these crochet sessions offer more than just crafting‚Äîthey‚Äôre a hands-on way to explore geometric forms, including complex shapes like hyperbolic surfaces.
