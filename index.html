                        Some of y'all might have noticed that you or your friends have been feeling a bit under the weather recently. That would be due to none other than what I‚Äôve dubbed the Shad Plague, which is probably some sort of cold or flu. It‚Äôs not too serious, but being sick isn‚Äôt fun and spreading contagions is, like, the least nonchalant thing you could do.
                        So what should you do about it? If you‚Äôre feeling unwell, I‚Äôd recommend that you:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="workshop-content" style="margin-left:2em; padding-left:1.5em;"></ul>
                        <li>Wear a mask</li>
                        <li>Inform a PA or director</li>
                        <li>Drink lots of water</li>
                        <li>Rest (A LOT)</li>
                        <li>SLEEP</li>
                        <li>Drink tea (ginger is a great choice) or otherwise consume warm liquids</li>
                        <li>Take warm showers</li>
                        <li>If you need to, skip scheduled activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="workshop-content"></p>
                          Even if you feel fine, you should DEFINITELY STILL SLEEP and take care of yourself.

                            The workshop on coding run by Paul Alves and Mariarosa Schiering, was a very entertaining exploration of both software and hardware. 
                            In the workshop we got to use Python to create effects in the real world, such as making a miniature lightshow accompanied by audio using the hub and making a small scale mobile vehicle create geometric shapes of our choosing on a physical paper.
                            We used the Ti-Nspire to code on a handheld device, and learned how to utilize the unique console in order to create an output visible outside of the device.
                            We spent some time trying to use the TI-Innovator hub to create music and colored flashes reminiscent of a traffic light.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "workshop-content">
                            We also used a TI-Rover to create a variety of shapes! By placing a marker through the vehicle, and creating a variety of regular polygons and some more unique shapes. From pentacontagons to hearts, the creativity on display was unparalleled. As someone who has had prior experience with Python, the workshop really helped to show how coding can manifest itself in engaging ways in the real world in a thought provoking manner.

                    <p class="workshop-speaker">By Michael Yang
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        The Choose Your Own Rec Session (CYO Rec) was one of the most anticipated rec sessions in shad and I would like to give you my experience in the basketball rec. We started off the rec by heading to St Jerome‚Äôs University, where they had a decent but claustrophobic-sized gym. It definitely didn‚Äôt feel like a full court. Joe commenced the rec session with a five minute warm-up to get the blood pumping. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Everybody was out there practicing shots on ten foot basketball hoops with chain nets. After warm up, we were told to line up for the game and split using the alternating 1-and-2 method. We played casual-rule competitive basketball. It was intense as Jonnathan and Dhruv made good competition, just like Lebron and Jordan. Next, we played bump, a game where two people shoot and if the second person gets the ball in before the first, the first is out. This went on until it was almost time to leave, and we had a do-your-own-thing cooldown until we left. The basketball rec was so fun and I hope everybody enjoyed their own rec as well!

                        As most of you know, badminton was the highest in demand out of all the other options. Curious to know what it was like? With Kayvon, Lydia and Claire, we set out on a 10 min walk to the small gymnasium that was like a cage of humidity, we were already sweating before even starting! Before reaching the gymnasium we passed the gym which was actually surprisingly big with lots of kinds of weights and equipment. The building also looked relatively new and very well maintained.                    </p>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        The University of Waterloo seems to fund the sports section quite well. Then, we separated into two groups: one would play competitive, the other more chill. We played in pairs and switched every 5 min. 
                        At last, when we were heading back, most of us were still bubbling with energy, so we ran back to United! Or should I say more of a fast jog. It was truly great and it felt nice to sweat and move our bodies together as a team. Hopefully it went just as well in the others!

                        Are you fascinated by geometric shapes? If so, don‚Äôt miss the crochet roundtable at Salon! What started as a cozy pastime during our camping nights has blossomed into a nightly tradition. Led by Susan, these crochet sessions offer more than just crafting‚Äîthey‚Äôre a hands-on way to explore geometric forms, including complex shapes like hyperbolic surfaces.

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Crocheting is the perfect way to relax your mind and stretch your fingers after a day of challenging math or physics. Susan‚Äôs handmade creations‚Äîfrom stylish hats to adorable crocheted cats and dogs‚Äînever fail to impress and delight.
