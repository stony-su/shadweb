                        Some of y'all might have noticed that you or your friends have been feeling a bit under the weather recently. That would be due to none other than what I‚Äôve dubbed the Shad Plague, which is probably some sort of cold or flu. It‚Äôs not too serious, but being sick isn‚Äôt fun and spreading contagions is, like, the least nonchalant thing you could do.
                        So what should you do about it? If you‚Äôre feeling unwell, I‚Äôd recommend that you:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="workshop-content" style="margin-left:2em; padding-left:1.5em;">
                        <li>Wear a mask</li>
                        <li>Inform a PA or director</li>
                        <li>Drink lots of water</li>
                        <li>Rest (A LOT)</li>
                        <li>SLEEP</li>
                        <li>Drink tea (ginger is a great choice) or otherwise consume warm liquids</li>
                        <li>Take warm showers</li>
                        <li>If you need to, skip scheduled activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                          Even if you feel fine, you should DEFINITELY STILL SLEEP and take care of yourself.

                            Today‚Äôs the last day for the workshop, and today, the quantum mechanics workshop split it into five main parts: wave-particle duality, photon experiments and detection, proving photons, quantum fireworks through experiment, quantum computing, and applications. Shads at the workshop learned that quantum objects like photons and electrons exhibit both wave and particle behavior, depending on the experiment. Interferometers, such as the Mach-Zehnder, demonstrated wave-like interference, while the photoelectric effect and coincidence experiments confirmed the particle nature of light. Shads also learned how beam splitters and phase shifts reveal these dual behaviors. A highlight was the quantum fireworks experiment, which used interference to determine whether a firework was a dud without setting it off directly. Finally and foremost, Shads learned how quantum computing uses qubits and principles like superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Technologies like optical coherence tomography and quantum simulators show how theory translates to real-world applications. This workshop gave Shads hands-on insight into the powerful world at the quantum level.

                        The final day of Workshops has come and on the final day, the anatomy lab did a physical presentation of the entire nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and the nerves! There were isolated brain parts and cross sections of these parts to allow the internals to be viewed. The volunteers pointed out all the major parts of the brain and described the roles they play in our lives. Our brain is really well protected and plays such a crucial role. It was passionating to discover the structure of the brain; we ended the workshop on a great note!

                        Waterloo Civil Engineer alumni, our dear Jon Martin, continues his presentation in civil engineering, and today, he covered key innovations in Civil Engineering for the better of society, and the math concepts in their construction.
                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        These innovations that he explained are: basket weaved roads, which is a type of interchange where one highway interchanges itself, and double and turbo roundabouts, which help decrease the speeds of vehicles in which is minimizing the effects of accidents. In addition, Jon explains the math concept of centrifugal force where the friction force arises in a rotating motion. Building off centrifugal forces, he explains superelevation, a crucial design technique that counteracts the centrifugal forces when skidding and turning when travelling on a curve.

                    <p class="workshop-speaker">By Daniel & Ruibo</p>

                        As the first Rec By Shads drew near, so did a question in the hearts of us all. ‚ÄúWill this be able to stack up to the other Recs?‚Äù. It was a high bar to meet, but the creativity and innovations of Houses 1 and 2 did not fall short. House 1 collaboratively presented us with an engaging, unique game that tested our delegation abilities. The game encouraged us to adapt to everyone's unique skillset so that our house could get to the sandcastle making process the fastest. The creation of the sandcastles was frantic, but they were very effective at pushing our imaginative skills to the next level. Starting with a few student group battles, setting the stage for the showdown between Joe and Jon. The match ended up with Joe‚Äôs victory, completing his throws while Jon remained struggling. House 2‚Äôs game was more simple fun, being an anarchical game of handball that encouraged collaboration and active moving. Five groups fight on their own, everyone is locked in, moving fast. Darren summarizes the whole energetic session with a single word: ‚ÄúChaotic.‚Äù
