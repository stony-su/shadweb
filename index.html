The theme park seminar by Joe explored how we might transport large amounts of people off the main roads (and into attractions) to improve traffic within the park. Joe explores design layout, building techniques, clever tactics to extend rides and improve their capacity. 

<br> 
The Lego seminar by Jon details the multiple ways one can contribute to the LEGO community and join it. Jon explores a myriad of superfluous acronyms and their meaning of each, including building techniques, original creations, and competitions. 
<br>
Madeline's Game Theory seminar explored the sunk-cost fallacy and how it can appear in both our lives and in play, as well as the different decision-making process in the mind. Playing a variety of games such as Uno Flip or Bananagrams helped to highlight the different decision-making processes, and how we can be more impulsive or thoughtful depending on the pressure put on us.
<br>
Jiya‚Äôs seminar on Spotting Lies enlightened us on the nature of lies, and during the seminar we discussed the differing types of lies (lying through omission, white lies, lying through commissions). We played a variety of games to get a better understanding of why and how people tend to lie. At the end of the seminar, Jiya invited three brave Shads to share their two truths and a lie, giving us all a chance to test our lie-spotting skills in a fun way. 
<br>
Kayvan shared with us his adventures throughout his life. Notably the ones abroad: he went to Norway, Denmark and Germany! He showed us all the advantages of studying or doing an exchange program abroad. Going out of one's comfort zone is really one of the best ways to explore oneself and the world around you. Even though there are times where you might feel isolated or misunderstood, the experience is truly worth it. 
Kayvan also advised us that if we do something similar, it is essential to be fully immersed in the experience. Go out of your comfort zone! Don‚Äôt stay cozied up in your group of international students or people you are familiar with, try to find connections on new ground! One way to do it is to join school organizations or clubs, where you get to contribute with peers from that country and discover the culture. He also encouraged us to take any opportunities we might have to study abroad (ideally during undergrad) as it can deeply change an individual's view of life.

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                     Our trip to the farmers market was, quite simply, astounding. The sight of all these people coming together to create a place where people could eat, buy, and relax was heartwarming. While there, us SHADs got to split off and all have our own little adventures. Some people watched sword jugglers (@simon_says_show), some people bought posters, some people ate pasta out of a cheese wheel, and some people (Auritro) ate a whole turkey leg by themself. From posters, to plants, to hats, to sunglasses, and even watches, so many precious items were found at the market. Even a free potato!!

The shads have run ANOTHER rec (who would have guessed!) this time it was by house 4 and 6 together. Started with capture the flag- not capture the flag - but capture the flag well kinda it was with multiple balls and worked with tag rules. There was camping, jailbreaks and insane plays the perfect environment for a good time with the boys. Afterwards we played Californian kickball (or soccer baseball) which was a blast, literally! The amount of times we saw that ball fly into the distance probably made some of us blind! With a lot of screaming to boot, even the counselors got into it and especially milo! The final score of the game was 8-3 somewhat of a landslide but  everyone came out having a blast.

                        Are you fascinated by geometric shapes? If so, don‚Äôt miss the crochet roundtable at Salon! What started as a cozy pastime during our camping nights has blossomed into a nightly tradition. Led by Susan, these crochet sessions offer more than just crafting‚Äîthey‚Äôre a hands-on way to explore geometric forms, including complex shapes like hyperbolic surfaces.

                    <p class="workshop-content">
                        Crocheting is the perfect way to relax your mind and stretch your fingers after a day of challenging math or physics. Susan‚Äôs handmade creations‚Äîfrom stylish hats to adorable crocheted cats and dogs‚Äînever fail to impress and delight.
